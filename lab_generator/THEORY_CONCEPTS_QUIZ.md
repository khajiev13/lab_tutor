# Theory Concepts Quiz

## Data Resources Concepts

### Web Crawler Quiz

**Question 1: What are the key characteristics of web crawlers?**
A) They only collect data without impacting server resources
B) They consume server bandwidth and increase server load
C) They are completely harmless to websites
D) They only work on specific types of websites

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
B) Web crawlers facilitate network information collection and query, but they also introduce negative impacts by consuming server bandwidth and increasing server load as they use specific policies to browse as much information as possible.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF) Quiz

**Question 2: What are the three main anti-crawler policies of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?**
A) Blocking, filtering, and redirecting
B) Encryption, decryption, and authentication
C) Robot detection, browser validity check, and access frequency limitation
D) Logging, monitoring, and reporting

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
C) A WAF provides three anti-crawler policies: 1) robot detection by identifying User-Agent, 2) website anti-crawler by checking browser validity, and 3) CC attack protection by limiting the access frequency.

## Data Reduction Techniques

### Compression Quiz

**Question 3: What is the key difference between lossy and lossless compression?**
A) Lossy compression is always faster
B) Lossless compression works only for text files
C) Lossy compression allows only an approximate reconstruction of original data
D) Lossless compression is only used for images

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
C) Lossy compression means only an approximate representation of the original data can be reconstructed, while lossless compression allows data to be restored without losing any information.
</details>

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Quiz

**Question 4: What is the primary goal of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?**
A) To increase the complexity of data
B) To add more dimensions to the dataset
C) To compress data by projecting it into a smaller space with orthogonal vectors
D) To create more complex mathematical models

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
C) PCA assumes data consists of N tuples from k dimensions, and aims to obtain c "k-dimensional" orthogonal vectors that best represent the data, where c≤k, thus projecting the original data into a smaller space to achieve data compression.
</details>

### Dimensionality Reduction Quiz

**Question 5: What is the primary purpose of dimensionality reduction?**
A) To make data more complex
B) To increase computational time
C) To remove irrelevant attributes and reduce data processing amount
D) To add more features to the dataset

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
C) Dimensionality reduction aims to remove irrelevant attributes and reduce the amount of data processed by data analysis.
