| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | web crawler | Facilitate network information collection and query, but they also introduce the following negative impacts: Web crawlers always consume too much server bandwidth and increase server load as they use specific policies to browser as much information as possible. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |
| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | waf | Web application firewall provides three anti-crawler policies, 1）robot detection by identifying User-Agent, 2）website anti-crawler by checking browser validity, and 3）CC attack protection by limiting the access frequency, to comprehensively mitigate crawler attacks against your websites. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |
| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | self-operated data | The IT system, ERP, SCM, online office system, online transaction system, etc. of different organization. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |
| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | government data | Various departments are set up for social management purposes, such as the Public Security Bureau, the Ministry of Finance, etc., these organizations will build many business systems, for the purpose of effectively fulfilling the functions of the department. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |
| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | external data | The data outside the specific organization. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |
| Data Resources: Internal and External Data | internal data resources | All the data created by the organization and stored inside the organization, including organization self operated system, business transaction system, manufacturing system, finance system, human resources system, etc. | transcript BD 2-1 resources-attack  explaination_extraction.json |

| Data Reduction Techniques | concept hierarchy | Defines a set of mappings from low-level concept sets to high-level concept sets. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | discretization | Reduce the number of values of a continuous (value) attribute by dividing the range of the attribute (continuous value) domain value into several intervals. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | data cube aggregation | Gather n-dimensional data cubes into n-1 dimensional data cubes. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | numerosity reduction | Use smaller data to represent data, or use shorter data units, or use data models to represent data to reduce the amount of data. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | principal component analysis (pca) | Assumes that the data to be compressed consists of N tuples or data vectors taken from k dimensions. Principal component analysis and search to obtain c "k-dimensional" orthogonal vectors that best represent the data, where c≤k. In this way, the original data can be projected into a smaller space to achieve data compression | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | lossy compression | Only an approximate representation of the original data can be reconstructed. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | lossless compression | Compressed data can be restored without losing any information. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | attributes subset selection | Goal is to Find the smallest attribute subset and ensure that the probability distribution of the new data subset is as close as possible to the probability distribution of the original data set | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | dimensionality reduction | Remove irrelevant attributes and reduce the amount of data processed by data analysis. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
| Data Reduction Techniques | data reduction | Technology is used to help obtain a condensed data set from the original huge data set, and make this condensed data set maintain the integrity of the original data set, so that data analysis on the condensed data set is obviously efficient higher, and the results of analysis are basically the same as those obtained by using the original data set. | Bigdata analysis 3-5_extraction.json |
