  "topic": "Recommendation Systems: Collaborative, Content-Based, and Knowledge-Based Filtering",
  "summary": "This session introduces recommendation systems, a subclass of information filtering systems that predict user preferences for items. Recommendation algorithms are categorized into collaborative filtering, content-based, and knowledge-based approaches. Collaborative filtering relies on user responses to items, while content-based filtering uses item features. Collaborative filtering is further divided into neighborhood-based (user-based and item-based) and model-based algorithms. User-based filtering recommends items based on similar users' preferences, while item-based filtering recommends items similar to those a user has already chosen. Content-based filtering recommends items based on the similarity of item features to a user's past favorites. The session details the steps for user-based and item-based filtering, including calculating user similarity using Jaccard, cosine, Euclidean, and Pearson distances, and computing user interest in items.",

  "original_text": "Hello everyone, I am Haiying Che, from Institute of Data Science and knowledge Engineering\nSchool of Computer Science, in Beijing Institute of Technology\nIn this chapter, we introduced some useful platform， Spark MLlib and TensorFlow.\nAnd in this session, we will talk about a typical big data analysis application, Recommendation System\nA recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item.\nIn simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Recommendation system is widely used in many fields, like Netflex, Amazon, JD, TaoBao\nQQ music etc.\nRecommendation Algorithms can be roughly divided into 3 categories. Collaborative filtering, content based and knowledge based. And the big difference between Collaborative filtering algorithm and content-based algorithm is that content based algorithm relies on the item features themselves, but the Collaborative filtering relies on how other user respond to the same item.\nCollaborative filtering can be further divided into Neighborhood-based and model based, neighborhood-based algorithm includes user-based and item-based algorithm, and we will discuss in this session. Model based algorithms include Latent Factor model, Graph model and others. In latent Factor model, I will use matrix factorization as example to explain.\nThe content-based recommendation algorithm recommends items based on item features, which include structured features and unstructured features.\nAnd the third category is knowledge-based algorithms.\nLet ‘s look at the diagram,\non the left it is the Collaborative filtering, exampled by user-based filtering algorithm.\nit shows that the similar users will have the similar preferences for articles,\nand the similar users are defined based on the common articles (the green and red) they read.\nSince they are similar users, the article read by her (the blue article) can be recommended to him.\nOn the right , it is content-based filtering recommendation , the red article and the green article are defined similar articles based on the article’s features, and when the red article is read by the user, the green article will be recommended to the same user.\nThis picture shows the user-based filtering and item-based filtering.\nIn user-based filtering, we find the similar users based on the common items they chose before,\nhere Tim chose Ice cream with Egg Roll, chocolate, ice cream cone and donut,\nand John chose chocolate ice cream cone, Tim and John have certain items in common, then we define them similar users.\nfor the items Tim has chosen and John not, we can recommend to John, here are the Ice cream with Egg Roll and donut.\nIn item-based filtering, we define the Ice cream with Egg Roll and ice cream cone as similar items based on the user chosen behavior,\nand John has chosen the ice cream cone, so we recommend the Ice cream with Egg Roll to him.\nWe will explain the user-based filtering and item-based filtering in detail.\nIn this session we will explain 3 main Recommendation System Algorithms,\nUser-based filtering, Item-based filtering, and Content Based Filtering.\nFirst let ‘s look at User-based filtering Recommendation System Algorithms.\nThe steps for User-based filtering are shown in the diagram,\n1） we collect the User purchase records,\n2） we build Item to User table based on the User purchase records.\n3） the User to User matrix is built based on Item to User table;\n4） the User – User similarity matrix is built based on User to User matrix ;\n5 ）then calculate the user's interest in different items.\n6） Get recommendation result based on the user's interest in different items.\nUser-based collaborative filtering is an algorithmic framework where the similar users are identified based on the similarity with the active user, and then scoring of the items is done based on neighbor’s ratings followed by a recommendation of an item based item’s scores by the recommendation system.\nMultiple users choose many of the same items, we can call these users similar users.\nIn the user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, we believe that: a user will like items that his or her similar users like with higher probability.\nSo how to calculate the similarity of the users.\nUsually use Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance and Pearson distance to calculate the similarity between two users.\nLet N(u) be the set of items that user U likes, and N(v) be the set of items that user V likes.\nJaccard similarity, cosine similarity calculation methods are shown here.\nLet us make an example to get recommendation result using User-based collaborative filtering.\nHere the big ABCD are users, and the small a b c d and e are items,\nBased on the User purchase records, we build the item- user table, which shows for each item, all the uses who have purchased this item.\nFor example, item a is purchased by user A and B, item b is purchased by User A and C, etc.\nThen User - User matrix is built based on the item to user table, in the way that each element value is the numbers of common items purchased by the row user and column user.\nFor example, the element of the first row and second column is calculated by the common items number of user A and B, they have just one common item which is item a, so the value is 1.\nThe other matrix element value is calculated in the same way.\nBased on the User - User matrix we just calculated, use Cosine similarity we can calculate the User – User similarity matrix,\neach element in this matrix is the similarity of the user in corresponding row and user in corresponding column.\nHere N(u) is the set of items that user U likes, and N(v) is the set of items that user V likes.\nAfter we have the User – User similarity matrix,\nFor each candidate item i, the degree that the user u is interested in it P(u,i) can be computed using the above formula.\nSuppose we want to recommend items to user A,\nselect K = 3 similar users,\nand similar users are B, C and D, based on the User – User similarity matrix\nthen the items that B, C and D chose and A has not chosen are c and e,\nthen calculate user A 's interest in item c, P (A, c) and e, P (A, e) respectively,\nthey both are 0.7416, which means User A likes c and e equally.\nNow let’s look at Item-based filtering\nNow let’s look at the Item-based collaborative filtering.\nCalculate the similarity between items and recommend items with high similarity to the items chosen by users.\nIn the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, we believe that: the similarity between item A and item B is because users who like item A also like item B.\nThe calculation is also based on the user purchase records.\nItem-item matrix is computed based on that.\nIn the Item-item matrix , each element is the number of the users who chose the item in the corresponding row and the item in the corresponding column.\nFor example, on the right, in the Item - Item matrix, the value of the element in the first row, second column, the number of the users who chose both item a and item b is one, just user A.\nThe other elements can be calculated in the same way.\nNow let ‘s calculate the Similarity of\nLet N(i) be the set of users who like item i, and N(j) be the set of users who like item j,\nand Intersection of N(i) and N(j) be the number of users who like both item i and item j.\ncosine similarity of item i and item j, Wij can be calculated as the formula,\nthe number of Intersection of N(i) and N(j) divided by the number of the union of N(i) and N(j) .\nItem - Item similarity matrix can be calculated using cosine similarity based on Item - Item matrix as showed on the right matrix.\nNow let ‘s compute the user's interest in different items.\nFor each candidate item j, the degree user u interested in item j, Puj can be calculate as the formula shows:\nwhere, N(u) represents the collection of items favored by user U, S (j, k) is the collection of k items most like item j,\nWij is the similarity between item i and item j, and Rui represents user u's interest in item i.\nNow we can get recommendation result.\nSuppose we want to recommend items to user B, select K = 3 similar items,\nso, the items user B has not chosen before are b, d and e.\nthen calculate P (B, d), P (B, b) and P (B, e) respectively and 1, 0.5, 0.5,\nthen we think User B likes d most and User B likes b, e equally\nFor user-based filtering\nHow to calculate the degree of user's interest in candidate items based on users?\nWe need to establish a connection between the user and the candidate item, and the connection is the user similarity.\nFor example on the left, we calculate the user A’s interest degree in Item c in P (A, c), the items have been purchased by users are B and D, so add the similarity of W.AB and W.AD.\nAnd for item-based filtering\nHow to calculate the degree of user‘s interest in candidate items based on items?\nWe still need to establish a connection between the user and the candidate item, and the connection is the item similarity.\nFor example on the left, we calculate User B’s interest degree in Item d in P (B, d), the items have been purchased are item a and item c, so add the similarity of W.da and W.dc.\nNow let’s look at Content-Based Filtering\nContent-based Filtering Recommendations, is the first recommendation algorithm that recommends items similar to a user's past favorite items.\nThe key here is the measure of item similarity, which is the core of the algorithm application process.\nThree main steps:\nItem Representation: extracting some features (content) for each item to represent them\nProfile Learning: Using the feature data of a user's past favorite (or not favorite) items to learn the user's preference features (that is user’s profile)\nRecommendation Generation: By comparing the user profile obtained in the previous step with the features of the candidate items, a set of items with the highest relevance is recommended to this user.\nIn this session, we learned 3 main Recommendation System Algorithms,\nUser-based filtering, Item-based filtering and Content-Based Filtering\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me."
