  "topic": "Data Resources: Internal and External Data",
  "summary": "This session discusses data resources, dividing them into internal and external data based on organizational boundaries. Internal data includes data from self-operated systems, business transaction systems, manufacturing, finance, and HR systems, as well as historical documents, emails, and IoT sensor data from automated production lines. External data encompasses data from other organizations' business operating platforms and IoT devices, government-collected data, and internet data from social media and other online sources. Government data is characterized by high credibility and integrity. Self-operated data comes from IT systems like ERP and SCM. IoT data collection is incorporated for data enrichment. Data is extracted and stored in relational databases, data warehouses, document databases, or graph databases, then processed using platforms like Hadoop and Spark, and analyzed with tools like TensorFlow and IBM Watson. Visualization tools like Tableau are used. Internet data presents challenges due to varying IT levels, crawler control policies, diverse data formats, and authenticity concerns. Internal and external data sources are crucial for comprehensive big data analysis, enabling business improvement, customer profiling, and better decision-making.",

  "original_text": "Hello everyone, I am Haiying Che, from Institute of Data Science and knowledge Engineering\nSchool of Computer Science, in Beijing Institute of Technology, in this session, we will discuss\nSome idea about Data Resources.\nAccording to organization boundary, we can divide the data into internal data and external data. By the way， the reason we want to divide the big data resources into internal and external is, the methods and tools of getting internal data and external data are different.\n1 The internal data resources refer to all the data created by the organization and stored inside the organization,\nIncluding organization self operated system, business transaction system, manufacturing system, finance system, human resources system, etc. these are mainly structured data.\nOrganization internal data also include some historical legacy data, such as some documents data, emails and etc.\nBesides there are some internal IoT devices can generate some data, for example, there are lots of sensors in the manufacturing Automated production line, these sensors can collect many production status data, which can facilitate the manufacture analysis.\n2 External data refer to the data outside the specific organization.\nExternal data includes\n2.1 other organization business operating platform data, like data from other organization’s business transaction system, manufacturing system, finance system, human resources system, accounting system etc.\n2.2 other organization’s IoT devices generated data\n2.3 the government collected and published data\n2.4 internet or mobile internet data, published by all the internet nodes, like social media, blog data, YouTube data, Wikipedia data etc.\nAll these internal and external data could be the data resources for analysis.\n1 Government data, various departments are set up for social management purposes, such as the Public Security Bureau, the Ministry of Finance, etc., these organizations will build many business systems, for the purpose of effectively fulfilling the functions of the department.\nThe data generated by these systems is mainly stored in the corresponding data center in a specific structure. The data contains great value inside, which can provide data support for the formulation of government macro policies, national security prevention and control, and effective social management.\nGovernment data has the characteristics of high credibility, good integrity, strong real-time, and clear entity description.\n2 Self-operated data refer to the IT system, ERP, SCM, online office system, online transaction system, etc. of different organization.\n3 Incorporate IoT data collection into the consideration of data enrichment.\nInside the organization, all the business data was collected from different business systems, like CRM, ERP, marketing system, finance system, HR system, Supply chain system and other data.\nAll these data were extracted and stored in the data storage, which could be the relational database like SQL Server, data warehouse like Hive, or document database like Mongo DB, or graph database like neo4j,\nand then process the data using data processing platform like Hadoop, spark etc.\nAnd analysis the data with the tools like TensorFlow, R, IBM Watson etc.\nAfter the data has been processed and analyzed, we can also visualize the data using visualization tools like tableau.\nThrough the big data analysis, we can get the business improvement, benefit analysis, revenue analysis, customer profiles, suitable pricing, some business patterns and so on, all these can help organization understand the customer and market better, provide better product and services, make better decision and improve their business strategy.\nIn addition to the internal data, there are also external data available for analysis.\nExternal data is mainly internet data, whose channel includes web portal, government open information, social media, E-business public data and some special forum focusing specific topic.\nInternet has huge amount of data, but when you collect data from internet you should be aware of some issues.\n1） there are Different IT level and structure of different website, there is no unified collection method for all the websites.\n2）Different websites have different control policy of crawlers, Why?\nBecause Web crawlers facilitate network information collection and query, but they also introduce the following negative impacts:\n2.1 Web crawlers always consume too much server bandwidth and increase server load as they use specific policies to browse as much information of high value on a website as possible.\n2.2 Bad actors may use web crawlers to launch DoS attacks against websites. As a result, websites may fail to provide normal services due to resource exhaustion.\n2.3 Bad actors may use web crawlers to steal mission-critical data on your websites, which will damage your economic interests.\n3） The internet data could be form of text, tables, audio, and video, The different form increase the difficulty of collection. Because you need to design different ways to collect them.\n4） Internet Data’s authenticity and data quality are inferior to other data。\nBecause anyone can publish data in the internet, nobody is responsible for the data authenticity and data quality, which make its authenticity and data quality are inferior to other data, like the internal data.\nLet’s summarize the data channels\nIf we want to do big data analysis, we need to have enough data, the data can be collected from inside or outside the organization, which are internal and external data correspondingly.\nInternal data includes the business system data, archived data, like documents, emails etc. and organizational IoT data.\nExternal data includes government public data, other organization data, internet data, and outside IoT data.\nIn this session we learned the bigdata resources, internal and external data. Based on Multi-dimension data, we can get comprehensive understanding of organization or business.\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me."
