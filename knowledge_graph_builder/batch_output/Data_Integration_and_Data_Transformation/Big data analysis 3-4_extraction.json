  "topic": "Data Integration and Data Transformation",
  "summary": "This session discusses data integration and data transformation. Data integration involves integrating data from multiple sources into a consistent storage, addressing pattern matching, data redundancy, and data value conflicts. Pattern matching recognizes and maps real-world entities from different sources. Data redundancy is handled by identifying attributes with different names or derived attributes. Data value conflicts arise from differences in representation, scales, or coding. Data transformation changes data to facilitate efficient analysis, using methods like binning, clustering, and regression to eliminate noise or discretize data. Aggregation uses calculation results to represent detailed data. Data generalization replaces low-level data with higher-level concepts. Data normalization scales data proportionally to eliminate deviations caused by different numerical attribute sizes, using methods like min-max normalization and z-score normalization. Attribute construction uses existing attributes to create new ones, improving pattern knowledge and mining accuracy.",

  "original_text": "Big data analysis 3-4\nHello everyone, I am Haiying Che, from Institute of Data Science and knowledge Engineering\nSchool of Computer Science, in Beijing Institute of Technology, in this session, we will discuss Data transform .\nData transform can include Data integration and Data transform. Let’s look at Data integration first.\nData integration:\nIntegrate data from multiple data sources into a consistent storage, which could involve the task Pattern matching, Data redundancy processing and Data value conflict solving;\nLet’s look these 3 tasks one by one.\nFirst one is Pattern matching. Integrate metadata from different data sources.\nWe can recognize the real-world entity from different data sources and mapping them together,\nlike A.cust-id=B.customer_no.\nThen deal with Data redundancy issue,\nThe same attribute will have different field names in different databases.\nOne attribute can be derived from another attribute. For example, the average monthly income attribute in a customer data table can be calculated based on the monthly income attribute.\nAnd Some redundancy can be detected by correlation analysis.\nThen solve the Data value conflict problem.\nFor a real-world entity, its attribute values from different data sources may be different.\nSuch as Differences in representation, different scales, or differences in coding, etc.\nFor example:\nthe weight attribute uses the metric system, like kg, g in one system, but uses the imperial system like pound in another system.\nSame price attributes in different locations using different currency units, $, pound, RMB\nAfter data integration , then let’ come to data transform.\nData transform means, in order to facilitate efficient analysis , we need change the data from one form to another form.\nWe can use smooth methods like Binning Clustering Regression to eliminate the noise Or discretize continuous data, and increase granularity.\nBy doing this, we can reduce the data amount for further analysis.\nSecond transformation is Aggregation.\nwe can use calculation result to represent the detail data.\nFor example: daily sales (data) can be aggregated to get the monthly or annual total.\nAnd these aggregation data are more convenient for big data analysis.\nThird transformation is Data generalization. Which means Replace low-level data objects with more abstract (higher-level) concepts.\nFor example:\nstreet attributes can be generalized to higher-level concepts, such as: city, country.\nSimilarly, numeric attributes, such as age attributes, can be mapped to higher-level concepts, such as young, middle-aged, and old.\nThe fourth transformation is Data Normalization.\nWhich means The data is scaled proportionally to make it fall into a specific area, so as to eliminate the deviation of the mining results caused by the different sizes of the numerical attributes.\nSuch as mapping the salary income attribute value to the range of [-1.0,1.0].\nThe methods for Data Normalization could be\n(1) Min-Max normalization\n(2) Zero-mean normalization (z-score normalization)\n(3) Standardization of decimal calibration\nThe fifth transformation is Attribute construction.\nUse the existing attribute set to construct new attributes and add them to the existing attribute set to help dig deeper pattern knowledge and improve the accuracy of mining results.\nFor example: According to the width and height attributes, a new attribute can be constructed: area.\nIn this session we discussed Data integration and data transform.\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me."
