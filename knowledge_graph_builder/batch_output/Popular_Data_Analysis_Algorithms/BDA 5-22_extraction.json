  "summary": "This chapter introduces popular data analysis algorithms, broadly categorized into data mining and machine learning algorithms. Data mining includes classification, clustering, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection. Machine learning encompasses supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning covers regression, classification, and deep learning. Unsupervised learning includes clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Semi-supervised learning features self-training and low-density separation models, while reinforcement learning involves dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods. The chapter explains eight popular algorithms: Linear Regression, k-means Clustering, k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, Apriori, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), using YouTube videos for explanation.",
