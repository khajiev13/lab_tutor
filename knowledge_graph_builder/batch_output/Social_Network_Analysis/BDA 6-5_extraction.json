  "topic": "Social Network Analysis",
  "summary": "This session introduces social network analysis, its metrics, and visualization techniques. A social network is defined as a structure of social actors, dyadic ties, and interactions. Social network analysis identifies patterns and influential entities using nodes and edges. Key metrics include Average Clustering Coefficient, Eigenvector Centrality, Average Path Length, Average Degree, Network Diameter, and PageRank. Visualization is crucial, with force-directed graph drawing algorithms like Fruchterman-Reingold being important. Hands-on experiments using NetworkX and Gephi are planned, covering data loading, graph generation, network analysis, visualization, and social network recommendation.",
