Machine learning is defined as the study of algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from data without explicit instructions. It is categorized into four main types: supervised learning, where machines classify based on labeled data; unsupervised learning, where machines classify objects without prior information by identifying patterns; semi-supervised learning, which includes models like self-training; and reinforcement learning, where an agent learns through trial and error using rewards and punishments. Deep Learning, a subfield of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks modeled after the human brain, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. Key differences between machine learning and deep learning are highlighted: deep learning requires larger datasets and GPUs, offers higher accuracy, but takes longer to train.

Using the data fed to the system, a machine learning algorithm is trained to provide output to the users. \nReinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.\nThough both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishment as signals for positive and negative behavior.\nAs compared to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is different in terms of goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, in reinforcement learning the goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. The figure below represents the basic idea and elements involved in a reinforcement learning model.\nDeep Learning is a recent field that occupies the much broader field of Machine Learning. \nDeep Learning is most famous for its neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks RNN, Convolutional Neural Networks CNN, and Deep Belief Networks. \nWhile other machine learning algorithms employ statistical analysis techniques for pattern recognition, Deep learning is modeled after the neurons of the human brain.\nThey are modeled after the structure and functioning of the human brain. In order to understand deep learning, we have to understand how the nervous system in the human body works. As we all know that our nervous system is built up of neurons. These neurons are able to grasp information that is transmitted to our body. These neurons have the ability to learn information over time. This principle of ‘learning’ is also utilized by artificial neural networks.\nAny Deep neural network will consist of three types of layers: The Input Layer; The Hidden Layer and The Output Layer\nWhat's the difference between the two?\nSimply explained, both machine learning and deep learning mimic the way the human brain learns. \nIts main difference is therefore the type of algorithms used in each case, although deep learning is more similar to human learning as it works with neurons. \nMachine learning usually uses decision trees and deep learning neural networks, which are more evolved. In addition, both can learn in a supervised or unsupervised way.\nfrom the table we can see , DL requires large data, ML can train on less data, DL can provide high accuracy but ML gives less accuracy; DL takes longer time to train, but ML takes less time to train,\nL requires GPU to train properly and ML trains on CPU, DL can be tuned in various different ways, but ML has limited tuning capabilities. \nData mining algorithms can be categorized into 4 groups, classification, clustering, correlation Analysis and anomaly detection.\nAnd the top 12 data mining algorithms is shown in the diagram, which include SVM, decision trees, neural network, ID3 algorithm, C4.5 algorithm K-nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes algorithm etc.\nIn this session we generally summarized the big data processing algorithms, which include the machine learning algorithms and data mining algorithms.\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me.", "document_id": "doc_85367b54"}
