For a single data source, model-level issues include violations of uniqueness, integrity constraints, and attribute dependence. Instance-level issues include spelling errors, redundant records, and attribute value conflicts. These errors can occur within a single attribute, between attributes in a record, or between records in a data source. When dealing with multiple data sources, all single-source problems can still exist, but new challenges arise from integration. At the model level, these include naming conflicts (same name for different objects or vice-versa) and structural conflicts (different representations for the same object). At the instance level, problems include different representations for the same value (e.g., 'M' vs. 'male'), record duplication, data conflicts, and different levels of data aggregation.", "char_interval": null, "alignment_status": null, "extraction_index": 2, "group_index": 1, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "KEYWORDS", "extraction_text": "Data Quality, Single Data Source, Multiple Data Sources, Model Level Issues, Instance Level Issues, Integrity Constraints, Naming Conflict, Structural Conflict, Data Cleaning", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 2445, "end_pos": 2457}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 3, "group_index": 2, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Model-level data quality issues", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 3292, "end_pos": 3297}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 4, "group_index": 3, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "Data quality problems that can be solved by improving model design, model conversion, and model integration.

Data quality issues can be divided into model-level issues and instance-level issues.\nModel level problems can be solved by improving model design, model conversion and model integration.\ninstance level Data quality problems refer to errors and inconsistencies in the actual data content. \nThese problems are often invisible at the model level and need to be resolved in the data cleaning process.\nFor the Single data resource data quality problems , in model level it could be Uniqueness, Integrity constraints, Attribute dependence and so on.\nFor the Single data resource data quality problems , in instance level it could be Spelling errors, Redundant and repeated records, Attribute value conflict and so on.\nFor the Multiple data resources data quality problems , in model level it could be Naming conflict, Structure conflict  and so on.\nFor the Multiple data resources data quality problems , in instance level it could be Different representations of values, Overlapping/duplicate records and so on.\nLet ‘s look at the Single Data resource Model level and Instance level data quality issues first\nFor a single data source, the data quality problem at the model layer largely depends on the integrity constraints of the design model on the data.\nThe integrity constraints of the database determine which data values are acceptable.\nFor example, a data to represent a date, the format and type of the date need to be restricted to ensure that the format of all date data in the database is uniform.\nHowever, for data sources that do not have uniform constraints such as files and web data, the possibility of causing data value errors and inconsistencies is greatly increased.\nFor a single data source, data quality problems at the instance level are unavoidable at the model design level, such as data input errors, etc.\nSingle Data resource data quality errors categories include\n) Attribute internal: limited to a single attribute value, such as age: 2000\n) Inside the record (between attributes): Different attribute values in the same record are inconsistent, for example, age and birthday cannot correspond\n)Internal data source (between records): inconsistency between different records of the same data source, for example, the name of the same ID is inconsistent\n)Between data sources: Some attributes in the data source are inconsistent with related values in other data sources, for example, the age corresponding to the same ID is inconsistent\nThe data quality problems of different levels and scopes correspond to different data cleaning methods. A clear data level range is the basis for finding a reasonable data cleaning method\nNow Let ‘s look at the Multiple Data resource Model level and Instance level data quality issues\nIn the case of multiple data sources, data from different data sources need to be integrated. Each data source is often created by a specific application to meet the needs of specific users, and the data model design of each data source will be very different. In addition, each data source may contain dirty data, and different data sources may have different representations, data duplication, or data conflicts for the same data. \nTherefore, the data quality problem in the case of a single data source is in the case of multiple data sources The next still exists. In addition, in the case of multiple data sources, data cleaning faces many new problems, such as structural conflicts, naming conflicts, duplicate records, etc.\nThe main problems at the multi-data source model level are naming conflicts and structural conflicts:\nNaming conflict refers to using the same name for different data objects or using different names for the same data object.\nThere are many different situations of structural conflicts, which usually refer to different ways to represent the same data object in different data sources. For example, the same object has different attribute granularity in different data sets, different composition structures, different data types, and different Integrity constraints, etc.\nThe conflict at the data instance level refers to the conflict of specific data. \nThe data quality problems existing in a single data source may appear in different forms in different data sources, such as record duplication and record conflict. Even if different data sources have the same attribute name and data type, there may be different data value representations. For example, the description of gender can be expressed as male, female, or as M, F.\nOr the data deserves different interpretations, such as the U.S. dollar, euro and other currency measurement units\nIn addition, the information provided by different data sources may be aggregated at different levels. For example, a single record in a data source describes the sales information of a certain product, while a record in another data source describes a group of similar products. sales information\nIn this session we discussed some concrete Data quality issues.\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me.", "document_id": "doc_1288f39d"}
