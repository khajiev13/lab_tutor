The model of data generation has shifted from a few companies producing content to a new model where everyone is both a generator and consumer of data through platforms like social media. Big Data is defined not just by its large volume but by its complexity, encompassing both structured and unstructured data that is difficult to manage with traditional methods. The evolution of data generation is traced through several stages: initial business transaction systems, the user-generated content stage driven by social media and mobile devices, and the current perception stage, characterized by continuous data generation from sensors and IoT devices. Key technological advancements like PCs, the internet, and mobile devices have fueled this growth. The era of Big Data enables decision-making based on data analysis, with AI playing a crucial role in processing this data. The lecture concludes by identifying Big Data, AI, IoT, and 5G as the four major empowering technologies of this era.", "char_interval": null, "alignment_status": null, "extraction_index": 2, "group_index": 0, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "KEYWORDS", "extraction_text": "Big Data, Data is the new Oil, user-generated content, perception stage, structured data, unstructured data, data analysis, AI, IoT, 5G", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 204, "end_pos": 4768}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 3, "group_index": 0, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Big Data", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 204, "end_pos": 212}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 4, "group_index": 0, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "Large, hard-to-manage volumes of data, both structured and unstructured, that inundate businesses and are difficult to manage using traditional methods."}}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Data is the new Oil", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 223, "end_pos": 242}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 5, "group_index": 1, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "An analogy explaining that original, raw data cannot be used directly and must be processed and refined before it can be applied to generate value, similar to how crude oil is refined."}}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "User-Generated Content Stage", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 3229, "end_pos": 3257}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 6, "group_index": 2, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "A stage in data generation where the development of social media and mobile devices enabled ordinary people to create and publish content in text, voice, and video formats."}}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Perception Stage", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 3273, "end_pos": 3289}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 7, "group_index": 3, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "The third stage of data generation, characterized by sensors with processing capabilities (like video cameras and wearable devices) that automatically and continuously generate data 24/7.

This theme was picked up again by Gerd Leonhard in 2009 and has become part of the mainstream.\nMark Getty is part of the Getty family that sold their oil empire to Texaco. He looked for something to do and decided that there was an opportunity to consolidate the market for photography. \nIn an Economist article in 2000 (http://www.economist.com/node/288515) he said: “Intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century. Look at the richest men a hundred years ago: they all made their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. All today’s richest men have made their money out of intellectual property.” \nAnd we say Data is like Crude oil…., because normally, original data cannot be used directly, they must be processed before really being applied.\nLike the crude need to be refined before use.\nThere are usually insights in big amount of data, but it cannot be easily found, the data scientist need analyze the data and found the pattern behind it.\nOne data set can be adapted to be used across several different products. Which means one data set can be used for different purpose. For example, the Taobao transaction data can be used to analyze the sales number of different products to find what product sales well and what not.\nThe same data can be also analyzed to find different customer’s purchasing preferences and recommend the customized related product to them.\nThe Model of Generating/Consuming Data has Changed, in the old model Few companies are generating data, all others are consuming data. the few companies like newspaper agency, publishing house, the broadcast and TV station, which are the resource of data.\nIn new model everyone could be the resource of data, all of us are generating data, and all of us are consuming data. we publish content in blog, twitter, Facebook, WeChat and YouTube, TikTok etc. and we also read the content there.\nNow comes what is big data, is that when the data gets big, it is called big data? The answer is No. \nlarge, hard-to-manage volumes of data – both structured and unstructured .\nWhich is not only big volume, but also is hard to manage by the traditional way we used before. \nThe traditional way we used to handle structured data, which is the data in table form with rows and columns.\n– that inundate businesses on a day-to-day basis. ... \nIt’s what organizations do with the data that matters. \nFrom the generation of electronic data to today, we experienced several stages.\nIn early stage, the data generated by the transaction systems as the business activity happened.\nFor example, when you buy something in Walmart, it would generate a sales record data in Walmart system.\nThen when the social media and mobile device developed, the ordinary people can send message and publish the content in text voice and video.\nSo, it is the user-generated content stage.\nThe 3rd stage-Perception stage \nSensor with processing capability, automatic; (7*24) generate data, like video camera, wearable device etc., which generate data all the time, no stop.   ---This is the main reason for big data\nThis diagram shows the IT progress, since 1980s, Von Neumann invented the computer, we entered information age, the PC can generate and process the data. \nAnd then the internet connects all the computer together, which make the data move and share among all the PC, this promote the information generation and exchanging. The information can easily transfer from one place to another end of the earth.\nThe popularity of mobile devices has liberated the limitation of computers on people's physical space, then people can create and publish contents wherever they are and whenever they want. Which make Big Data.\nNew York Times 2012 special column: The era of big data is here, decision-making relies more on data analysis. We have a lot of data from different aspects, connecting all this data and process it in the suitable way, we can extract useful information to support our decision making.\nAfter 2010, the AI era has come and it has become the second sprout of the technological ecology after the Internet. AI give the machine some intelligence, which can analyze the data itself, which help people analyze the data and react correspondingly.\nThis enable us analyze more widely and deeper consequently get more insight.\nFour major technologies empower are Big Data, AI, IoT, 5G.\nIn this session we learned the bigdata concepts, Thank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to connect me.", "document_id": "doc_156bf8c4"}
