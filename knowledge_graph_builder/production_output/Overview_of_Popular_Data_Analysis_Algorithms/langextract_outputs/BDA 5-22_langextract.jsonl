Che, from Institute of Data Science and knowledge Engineering\nSchool of Computer Science, in Beijing Institute of Technology, In this chapter we will learn some popular algorithms of data analysis\nGenerally Big data processing algorithm basically include data mining algorithms and Machine learning algorithms.\nData mining algorithms can be categorized into 4 groups, classification, clustering, correlation Analysis and anomaly detection.\nMachine learning algorithms include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nAnd in the scope of supervised learning there are regression, classification, and deep learning.\nAnd in the scope of unsupervised learning there are clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\nFor semi-supervised learning, it includes self-training and low-density separation models.\nand reinforcement learning include dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods.\nIn this chapter we will explain 8 popular algorithms, include Linear Regression, k-means Clustering, k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes algorithm, Apriori algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network,
