SNA is the interdisciplinary process of investigating these structures using networks and graph theory to identify patterns and influential entities. Key characteristics of social networks include low average distance between nodes, as exemplified by the 'Six Degrees of Separation' concept. The lecture covers various metrics for analyzing nodes, edges, and the overall network, such as Average Clustering Coefficient, PageRank, and Network Diameter. A significant focus is placed on visualization, particularly force-directed graph drawing algorithms like Fruchterman-Reingold, which arrange graphs aesthetically by simulating physical forces between nodes. The session concludes by outlining hands-on experiments using the 'Game of Thrones' dataset with tools like NetworkX (a Python package) and Gephi (visualization software) to perform network analysis, graph simplification, and visualization.", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 360, "end_pos": 372}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 2, "group_index": 1, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "KEYWORDS", "extraction_text": "social network analysis, graph theory, force-directed graph drawing, Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, NetworkX, Gephi, network metrics, nodes, edges, visualization", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 523, "end_pos": 546}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 3, "group_index": 2, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Social Network", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 1116, "end_pos": 1130}, "alignment_status": "match_exact", "extraction_index": 4, "group_index": 3, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "A social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors.

Eigenvector Centrality; Average Path Length etc.\nThe metrics about Network include Average Degree, Average Weighted Degree, Network Diameter, Graph Density, Shortest Path, Hits, Modularity, PageRank, Connected Components and etc.\nVisualization is an important way to analyze the social Network. \nForce-directed graph drawing is a good way to visualize the social Network. \nForce-directed graph drawing is an important technology on social network visualization. \nForce-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way. \nCurrently force-directed graph drawing algorithms are Force atlas algorithm, Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, Yifan Hu algorithm, etc.\nThe basic theory is assuming that there are forces between nodes and fits in physical models. \nAnd the goal is to make the whole system stable or has the lowest energy.\nFruchterman-Reingold algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithms. \nThis algorithm uses electromagnetism theories, and generates a circular graph.\nRepulsive force  divided by  k ;  Gravitation force \nFinal state is to make force balanced\nThe picture on the left is the Original graph and the picture on the right is Fruchterman-Reingold style, which is more aesthetically-pleasing. \nWe will hands on based on the data set of social network of “Game of throne” ,  using NetworkX and Gephi,\nNetworkX  is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. \nGephi is an open-source and free visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks.\nExperiment 1 includes Loading data and generate graphs, Network analysis, Visualization using Networkx and Edge bundling using datashader.\nExperiment 2 includes Load data and analysis, Graph simplifying using Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and Visualization and beautification\nExperiment 3 includes social network recommendation background setting, biased random walk, node representation learning and recommendation.\nall the experiments material including the manual and codes are provided on the platform, which can help you to do the hands-on.\nIn this session, we learned social network analysis,\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me.", "document_id": "doc_605e301a"}
