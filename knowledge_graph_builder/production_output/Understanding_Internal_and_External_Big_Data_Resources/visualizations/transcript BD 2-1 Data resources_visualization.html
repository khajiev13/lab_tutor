        Hello everyone, I am Haiying Che, from Institute of Data Science and knowledge Engineering
School of Computer Science, in Beijing Institute of Technology, in this session, we will discuss
Some idea about Data Resources.
According to organization boundary, we can divide the data into <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">internal data and external data. By the way， the reason we want to divide the big data resources</span> into internal and external is, the methods and  tools of getting internal data and external data are different.
The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">internal data resources</span> refer to all the data created by the organization and stored inside the organization, 
Including organization self operated system, business transaction system, manufacturing system, finance system, human resources system, etc. these are mainly structured data.
Organization internal data also include some historical legacy data, such as some documents data, emails and etc.
Besides there are some internal IoT devices can generate some data, for example, there are lots of sensors in the manufacturing Automated production line, these sensors can collect many production status data, which can facilitate the manufacture analysis.
External data refer to the data outside the specific organization.
External data includes
1 other organization business operating platform data, like data from other organization’s business transaction system, manufacturing system, finance system, human resources system, accounting system etc. 
2 other organization’s IoT devices generated data
3 the government collected and published data 
4 internet or mobile internet data, published by all the internet nodes, like social media, blog data, YouTube data, Wikipedia data etc.
All these internal and external data could be the data resources for analysis.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Government data</span>, various departments are set up for social management purposes, such as the Public Security Bureau, the Ministry of Finance, etc., these organizations will build many business systems, for the purpose of effectively fulfilling the functions of the department. 
The data generated by these systems is mainly stored in the corresponding data center in a specific structure. The data contains great value inside, which can provide data support for the formulation of government macro policies, national security prevention and control, and effective social management.
Government data has the characteristics of high credibility, good integrity, strong real-time, and clear entity description.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Self-operated data</span> refer to the IT system, ERP, SCM, online office system, online transaction system, etc. of different organization.
Incorporate IoT data collection into the consideration of data enrichment. 
Inside the organization, all the business data was collected from different business systems, like CRM, ERP, marketing system, finance system, HR system, Supply chain system and other data.
All these data were extracted and stored in the data storage, which could be the relational database like SQL Server, data warehouse like Hive, or document database like Mongo DB, or graph database like neo4j, 
and then process the data using data processing platform like Hadoop, spark etc.
And analysis the data with the tools like TensorFlow, R, IBM Watson etc.
After the data has been processed and analyzed, we can also visualize the data using visualization tools like tableau.
Through the big data analysis, we can get the business improvement, benefit analysis, revenue analysis, customer profiles, suitable pricing, some business patterns and so on, all these can help organization understand the customer and market better, provide better product and services, make better decision and improve their business strategy.
In addition to the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">internal data,</span> there are also external data available for analysis.
External data is mainly internet data, whose channel includes web portal, government open information, social media, E-business public data and some special forum focusing specific topic.
Internet has huge amount of data, but when you collect data from internet you should be aware of some issues.
） there are Different IT level and structure of different website, there is no unified collection method for all the websites.
）Different websites have different control policy of crawlers, Why?
Because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Web crawlers</span> facilitate network information collection and query, but they also introduce the following negative impacts:
1 Web crawlers always consume too much server bandwidth and increase server load as they use specific policies to browse as much information of high value on a website as possible.
2 Bad actors may use web crawlers to launch DoS attacks against websites. As a result, websites may fail to provide normal services due to resource exhaustion.
3 Bad actors may use web crawlers to steal mission-critical data on your websites, which will damage your economic interests.
） The internet data could be form of text, tables, audio, and video, The different form increase the difficulty of collection. Because you need to design different ways to collect them.
） Internet Data’s authenticity and data quality are inferior to other data。
Because anyone can publish data in the internet, nobody is responsible for the data authenticity and data quality, which make its authenticity and data quality are inferior to other data, like the internal data.
Let’s summarize the data channels
If we want to do big data analysis, we need to have enough data, the data can be collected from inside or outside the organization, which are internal and external data correspondingly.
Internal data includes the business system data, archived data, like documents, emails etc. and organizational IoT data.
External data includes government public data, other organization data, internet data, and outside IoT data.
In this session we learned the bigdata resources, internal and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">external data</span>. Based on Multi-dimension data, we can get comprehensive understanding of organization or business.
