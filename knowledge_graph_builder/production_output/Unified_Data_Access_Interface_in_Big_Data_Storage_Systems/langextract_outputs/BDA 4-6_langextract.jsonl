The data storing system itself has four parts: data collection/modeling, distributed file systems, distributed databases, and the Unified Data Access Interface (UDAI). The UDAI sits on top of the other storage components to provide data to the upper-level processing system. Early interfaces like ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) provided a set of APIs for database access using SQL but lacked capabilities for complex distributed environments, such as transaction management and handling heterogeneous data. To address this, the Data Access Layer (DAL) was introduced to manage persistent storage, CRUD operations, and concurrent processing. However, when systems need to access diverse, cross-platform data (e.g., files, XML, EJB components), a more advanced solution is required. The UDAI was developed for this purpose, defined as an interface supporting cross-platform heterogeneous data in a distributed environment. Its functions include unified data display, separating the interface from implementation, and shielding the application layer from data source complexities. The Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL) implements this, containing components like a unified query language, data models, a data conversion engine, and data source wrappers to transform varied data sources into unified data services.", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 284, "end_pos": 313}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 2, "group_index": 1, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "KEYWORDS", "extraction_text": "Unified Data Access Interface (UDAI), Data Storing System, ODBC, Data Access Layer (DAL), heterogeneous data, cross-platform access, CRUD, Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL)", "char_interval": null, "alignment_status": null, "extraction_index": 3, "group_index": 2, "description": null, "attributes": null}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "Unified Data Access Interface (UDAI)", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 5026, "end_pos": 5055}, "alignment_status": "match_lesser", "extraction_index": 4, "group_index": 3, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "Based on a unified data interface to support Cross-platform heterogeneous data in a distributed environment."}}, {"extraction_class": "CONCEPT", "extraction_text": "ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)", "char_interval": {"start_pos": 1297, "end_pos": 2611}, "alignment_status": "match_fuzzy", "extraction_index": 5, "group_index": 4, "description": null, "attributes": {"definition": "The industry's earliest application programming interface to provide database access, composed of a set of function calls with SQL statements at its core.

The industry's earliest application programming interface to provide database access is ODBC (open database connectivity), and the structured query language SQL is used as the database access language. \nODBC is essentially a set of database access APIs, composed of a set of function calls, and the core is SQL statements. \nAn ODBC-based operation on a database does not rely on any DBMS. The user directly transmits SQL statements to ODBC. \nAt the same time, ODBC does not rely on any DBMS for database operations, and does not directly deal with DBMS. \nAll database operations are completed by the corresponding ODBC driver. .\nHowever, database connection programming interfaces such as ODBC and JDBC can support SQL access by applications to the database, \nbut they cannot provide complex functions such as transaction management, concurrent scheduling, buffer management, heterogeneous database conversion and inheritance in a distributed computing environment. This introduces the data access layer. DAL is a layer of software that provides data exchange functions on top of the database. Its function is mainly to realize the persistent storage of application data, that is, write data into the database, and read data from the database and pass it to the application to realize data exchange. Specifically, it provides support for\nthe basic operations of CRUD (create retrieve update and delete) of the database. \nTransaction management, \nconcurrent processing\nheterogeneous data conversion. \nThere are many ways to implement the data access layer, the common ones are data access object DAO (data access Object), implementation based on ORM (Object/relation Mapping), service data object (service data object) service middleware\nWhen the system is extended to need to access cross-platform heterogeneous databases, the data type to be accessed may be UNIX, Linux or Windows, which can be forms, mails, XML documents, EJB components, Web services, images, audio/video files or For other unstructured data, it is difficult for a single DAO or ORM to support such cross-platform heterogeneous database access. And the technology of the big data application layer is also diversified and various standards. The design of the data access layer DAL needs to be compatible with various standard technologies and products, which introduces the Unified data access interface\nThe Definition is: Unified data access interface  is Based on a unified data interface to support Cross-platform heterogeneous data  in a distributed environment\nUDAI Functions include\nUnified data display, storage and management\nSeparation of access interface and implementation code, the change of the underlying database connection does not affect the unified data access interface\nShielding the differences of data sources and the details of database operations, making the application layer focus on data applications\nProvide a unified access interface and a unified query language\nUDAL -Unified data access layer\nShould include the following components\n） Unified data access interface/unified query language;\n） Data model/metadata/service model;\n）Data conversion engine/data service engine/data source manager;\n）Data source wrapper\nAll these can help to transform different format data from different data sources to unified data services and enable the data processing system to unified retrieve the needed data.\nUntil now, we learned all the four parts of Data storage system which include Data Acquisition / Extraction / Transforming / Modeling layer, distributed file system, non-relational database (NoSQL), and unified database Access interface. All these 4 parts work together to finish the getting data, cleaning and transforming data, logical and physical storing data, and unifying the data access.\nIn this session, we learned Unified Data Access Interface.\nthank you for your attention, if you have any question, feel free to contact me.", "document_id": "doc_0bc3a75a"}
